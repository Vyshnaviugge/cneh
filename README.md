Advanced IPv4 & IPv6 Subnet Calculator
A powerful, modern, client-side web application for calculating IPv4 and IPv6 subnet details, performing VLSM, converting IP formats, viewing CIDR charts, and accessing calculation history — all built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This tool runs 100% locally in the browser.
No backend, no frameworks, no external libraries.

🚀 Features
🔹 1. IPv4 & IPv6 Subnet Calculator
Auto-detects IPv4/IPv6 (or user can select)

Calculates:

Network Address

Broadcast Address (IPv4)

Subnet Mask (/prefix)

Wildcard Mask

Usable Host Range

Total Hosts / Addresses

IP Type classification:

Private / Public

Loopback

Link-local

Multicast

ULA / Global Unicast (IPv6)

🔹 2. VLSM Subnetting (Variable Length Subnet Masking)
Enter:

Base Network

Prefix

Department host requirements

Automatically generates:

Correct subnet sizes

Network & broadcast addresses

Host ranges

Usable hosts

Copy button for each subnet

🔹 3. IP Conversion Tools
Supports IPv4 and IPv6 conversion between:

IP → Decimal

Decimal → IP

IP → Binary

Binary → IP

IP → Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal → IP

Includes automatic formatting (grouping, padding, etc.)

🔹 4. CIDR Reference Charts
IPv4 CIDR blocks /8 to /30

IPv6 common prefixes /32, /48, /56, /64, /96, /112, /128

Hover to view mask & host count

Click to auto-fill prefix

🔹 5. History (LocalStorage)
Stores last 10 calculations

Click an entry → auto-load values + re-run calculation
